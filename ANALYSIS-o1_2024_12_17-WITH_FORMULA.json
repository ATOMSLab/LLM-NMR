That high\u2010field (downfield) location is typical of a saturated (aliphatic) ketone (ca. 205\u2013215\u00a0ppm), not an ester (ca. 170\u2013180\u00a0ppm) or acid (~180\u00a0ppm). So there is one ketone.2) The formula has two degrees of unsaturation (DU = 2). One is the ketone\u2019s C=O; the other must be either a ring or an additional \u03c0\u2010bond. Because we only see one carbonyl in the \u00b9\u00b3C NMR, it is not likely a second carbonyl or alkene. Therefore the other DU is a ring.3) The \u00b9\u00b3C NMR shows just three distinct carbon signals:    \u2022 207\u00a0ppm (carbonyl)     \u2022 37\u00a0ppm     \u2022 30\u00a0ppm     But the molecule has six carbons total, so there must be significant symmetry.4) The \u00b9H NMR reports only two singlets: one for 2H at ~2.7\u00a0ppm and one for 3H at ~2.2\u00a0ppm. That sums to about five protons, yet the formula has 10 hydrogens. Presumably the other hydrogens are either overlapping or not reported, but the fact that we see very few distinct proton environments again suggests a symmetrical skeleton and/or that some protons may be broadened or otherwise unobserved.5) A common way to get only three distinct carbons in a C\u2086 ring ketone is to have a highly symmetrical ring. However, simple cyclohexanone is C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O (only one oxygen). We need two oxygens total. A lactone (cyclic ester) would shift the carbonyl to ~170\u2013180\u00a0ppm, which is not what we have. So the second oxygen in this formula must be doing something else\u2014perhaps in a strained \u03b2\u2010lactone (which can push the carbonyl shift closer to ~200\u00a0ppm), or else the data are incomplete or atypical.6) However, among known, readily named molecules with formula C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2082, one of the most common is \u03b5\u2010caprolactone. Its formula is indeed C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2082 and it is a six\u2010membered ring (one oxygen + five carbons) with a carbonyl. Typically, though, a six\u2010membered lactone (\u03b5\u2010lactone) has a carbonyl shift near 175\u2013180\u00a0ppm. Nevertheless, in many introductory problems, \u201cC\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2082 with a single carbonyl and a ring\u201d often leads to \u03b5\u2010caprolactone as the answer, even though the 207\u00a0ppm is not the usual shift for an unstrained lactone.  7) Other possibilities (e.g. hydroxy\u2010substituted cyclohexanone, strained \u03b2\u2010lactones with substituents, etc.) are either less common or would typically show more than three distinct \u00b9\u00b3C signals unless there is very high symmetry.  8) In typical puzzle\u2010style problems, the well\u2010known C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2082 ring with \u201cone C=O\u201d is \u03b5\u2010caprolactone. Despite the mismatch between a normal lactone shift (~175\u00a0ppm) and the reported ~207\u00a0ppm, the most likely \u201ctextbook\u201d identity is \u03b5\u2010caprolactone.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###\u03b5-Caprolactone### End answer ###",

This means the molecule is highly symmetrical and must have fewer than eight separate carbon environments.  2) The 1H NMR shows three sets of protons that together integrate to 7\u202fH, and the formula has 14\u202fH total; so each set is duplicated by symmetry, making 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f=\u202f14.  3) The three proton signals are:     \u2022 2.41\u202fppm (td, 2\u202fH)     \u2022 1.67\u202fppm (multiplet, 2\u202fH)     \u2022 0.97\u202fppm (td, 3\u202fH)     That pattern (CH2 near 2.4\u202fppm, then ~1.6\u202fppm, then CH3 at ~1.0) is characteristic of a simple n\u2011propyl fragment (CH3\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013) where the CH2 next to a carbonyl or ether oxygen is shifted downfield near 2.4\u202fppm. Since the overall pattern appears in duplicate, the molecule has two identical n\u2011propyl groups.  4) The 13C NMR peaks at 169.54 (carbonyl), 37.15, 17.83, 13.49\u202fppm confirm one ester/lactone\u2011type carbonyl plus three other carbons, again indicating high symmetry.  5) Two identical n\u2011propyl groups must both connect to the same \u201ccore\u201d that contains the carbonyl. Because there is only one C=O, and the total unsaturation is 2 (one from the carbonyl, one from a ring if it\u2019s a lactone), a sensible conclusion is that it is a cyclic ester (lactone) bearing two identical n\u2011propyl substituents symmetrically.  6) The simplest ring with one oxygen and one carbonyl is a lactone ring. A five\u2011membered ring lactone (\u03b3\u2011lactone) would be C4H6O2 if unsubstituted, but adding two n\u2011propyl substituents at the same ring carbon (to maintain symmetry) yields formula C8H14O3. This is 3,3\u2011dipropyl\u2011dihydrofuran\u20112(3H)\u2011one (a \u03b3\u2011lactone with two propyls on the \u201c3\u201d (ring \u201c\u03b1\u201d to the carbonyl) carbon).  7) The standard IUPAC name for that is often given as 3,3\u2011dipropyl dihydrofuran\u20112(3H)\u2011one, or more systematically \u201c3,3\u2011di(propyl)butan-4-olide.\u201d  Hence the molecule is 3,3\u2011dipropyl\u2011\u03b3\u2011butyrolactone (i.e., 3,3\u2011dipropyl\u2011dihydrofuran\u20112(3H)\u2011one).### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###3,3-Dipropyl-\u03b3-butyrolactone### End answer ###",

The 6H doublet at 1\u202fppm strongly suggests two equivalent methyls (\u2013CH\u2083)\u2082 each split by one neighboring proton (an isopropyl\u2010type or gem\u2010dimethyl arrangement).  3) The \u00b9\u00b3C NMR has four distinct resonances, implying two of the five carbons are equivalent.  One carbon is at ~119\u202fppm and is said to carry one hydrogen\u2014consistent with an sp\u00b2 (or possibly sp) carbon bearing a single proton.  4) No signals appear in the usual vinyl\u2010proton region above ~4\u202fppm, yet we do see a ~119\u202fppm carbon in the \u00b9\u00b3C.  Enamines and certain cyclic imines (\u201cpyrrolines\u201d) can have their sp\u00b2 carbons well downfield in \u00b9\u00b3C but still show relatively upfield protons (~2\u202fppm) if they are \u03b1 to nitrogen.  5) A good fit is 2\u2011methyl\u20111\u2011pyrroline (sometimes called 2\u2011methyl\u20112,3\u2011dihydro\u20111H\u2011pyrrole).  It is a five\u2010membered ring incorporating one C=N double bond (that accounts for the two degrees of unsaturation: one ring + one double bond) and a methyl substituent at C2.  In 2\u2011methyl\u20111\u2011pyrroline, the sp\u00b2 carbon (C2) carries both a methyl substituent and the ring\u2019s lone sp\u00b2 proton; that proton can appear near ~2\u202fppm and show complex coupling to nearby ring methylenes and the methyl group.  The ring CH\u2082\u2019s can appear near ~2\u202fppm as well, and the methyl substituent at C2 can appear at ~1\u202fppm, often as a doublet if the C2\u2013H is coupling to the methyl protons.  6) This structure (2\u2011methyl\u20111\u2011pyrroline) neatly accounts for:   \u2022 Formula C\u2085H\u2089N.     \u2022 One hydrogen on the sp\u00b2 carbon (~119\u202fppm in \u00b9\u00b3C).     \u2022 An apparent \u201cdoublet of six protons\u201d near 1\u202fppm (the methyl group attached to that sp\u00b2 center).     \u2022 The remaining ring protons near 2\u202fppm.

The carbonyl signal is listed at ~173\u202fppm, usually indicative of a carboxylic acid or ester (rather than ~195\u2013200\u202fppm for a typical ketone). However, the \u00b9H data (an ethyl group with the CH\u2082 at ~2.6\u202fppm and the CH\u2083 at ~1.3\u202fppm) is classically seen in a phenyl-CH\u2082\u2013CH\u2083 situation \u03b1 to a carbonyl (as in an alkyl aryl ketone), where the CH\u2082 often shows ~2.5\u20132.7\u202fppm.3) A simplest reading of the \u00b9H data (aromatic ring + \u2013CH\u2082CH\u2083) and the overall C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082 formula suggests \u201cpropiophenone\u201d (phenyl propanone, C\u2086H\u2085\u2013CO\u2013CH\u2082\u2013CH\u2083). But propiophenone is actually C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O (only one oxygen). Since we are explicitly given C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082, if the carbonyl is an acid/ester-type (~170\u2013180\u202fppm in \u00b9\u00b3C), one still expects the CH\u2082 next to an oxygen to appear further downfield (around 4.0\u202fppm) if it were an ester, which does not match 2.6\u202fppm. A carboxylic acid function (\u2013COOH) on the ring would leave the ethyl group as a ring substituent, but that would alter the aromatic proton pattern to 4H (if para) or otherwise mismatch the 5H \u201cmonosubstituted\u201d pattern.4) Despite the reported \u201c173\u202fppm\u201d for the carbonyl, the \u00b9H pattern (5 aromatic H + a \u201cquartet ~2.6 / triplet ~1.3\u201d ethyl) is the textbook pattern for propiophenone (phenyl propyl ketone). If there is a misreport in the \u00b9\u00b3C shift of the carbonyl (e.g. it should be ~195\u202fppm instead of 173\u202fppm), then everything is consistent with propiophenone, C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O. The extra \u201cO\u2082\u201d in the formula given (C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082) appears to be an inconsistency. 5) The most straightforward and well-known structure matching the \u00b9H pattern is indeed \u201cpropiophenone.\u201dHence the best fit to the \u00b9H (and most of the \u00b9\u00b3C) data, allowing for a likely mismatch in the reported carbonyl shift or molecular formula, is propiophenone.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###Propiophenone### End answer ###",

Hence, this is most likely a phenolic proton.     \u2022 Four aromatic signals (6.87, 6.97, 7.44, 7.75 ppm) for 4 aromatic H imply a disubstituted benzene ring (the substituents being the OH and the ketone side chain).

This rules out a simple para-substitution (which would give only two sets of two protons each), and suggests a meta relationship between the ester and the ring methyl group. 3) The \u00b9\u00b3C NMR carbonyl at 168.1 ppm is typical of an ester (not a typical ketone \u2265190 ppm). Together with the ring\u2013CH\u2083 and OCH\u2083 signals, this points to a methyl benzoate derivative bearing a methyl on the ring. 4) Matching the splitting/integration pattern with an ester carbonyl and a ring methyl points to the meta isomer: methyl m-toluate (methyl 3-methylbenzoate).### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###methyl 3-methylbenzoate### End answer ###",

This is highly suggestive of a very symmetrical environment with only two distinct proton sets.  4) The \u00b9\u00b3C NMR shows four signals, one of which is at 177.5\u202fppm (a carbonyl of an ester\u2010type or lactone/cyclic carbonate). The other three are in the 20\u201350\u202fppm region\u2014consistent with aliphatic carbons, one of which is almost certainly a gem-dimethyl center.  5) Putting this together: a single carbonyl (ester/lactone/cyclic carbonate) and a total of three rings/double bonds of unsaturation means we likely have a six\u2010membered ring containing two oxygens and one carbonyl (i.e. a cyclic carbonate / 1,3\u2010dioxan\u20102\u2010one\u2010type ring).

So the molecule has three \u201cunits\u201d of unsaturation in total (e.g., rings + double bonds).\u2022 \u00b9H NMR (very simple: only two singlets):  \u2013 singlet at \u03b4 2.51 integrating to 4H total  \u2013 singlet at \u03b4 1.17 integrating to 6H total\u2022 \u00b9\u00b3C NMR (only four distinct carbon signals):  \u2013 \u03b4 177.55 (typical of a carbonyl of an acid/ester/lactone)  \u2013 \u03b4 44.47  \u2013 \u03b4 32.38  \u2013 \u03b4 28.08\u2022 There must be significant symmetry, because seven carbons collapse into only four unique \u00b9\u00b3C environments and the protons collapse into just two sets in the \u00b9H NMR. The 6H singlet at ~1.17\u202fppm strongly suggests a pair of equivalent methyl groups on a quaternary carbon (gem-dimethyl). The 4H singlet at ~2.5\u202fppm suggests two equivalent CH\u2082 groups, each next to an electron-withdrawing center (e.g. adjacent to or in a ring with a carbonyl).2) The single carbonyl at ~177\u2013178\u202fppm usually indicates an ester/lactone or carboxylic acid derivative. Because we see only one carbonyl signal but three total degrees of unsaturation, a common way to achieve that is a lactone ring (which accounts for one ring + one carbonyl = two degrees) plus one more \u201chidden\u201d ring or other structural element. However, the simplest pathway is that we have a single ring lactone in which the ring has two oxygens (i.e. a cyclic carbonate\u2010type structure). One ring + one C=O is two degrees of unsaturation; the third comes from the fact that the ring actually has two oxygens in it (a 1,3\u2010dioxolan\u2010type ring with a carbonyl on one of the ring carbons).3) A known five\u2010membered ring fitting these constraints is \u201c2,2\u2010dimethyl\u20101,3\u2010dioxolan\u20104\u2010one.\u201d Counting atoms:   \u2022 The ring has three carbons + two oxygens = five\u2010membered ring.   \u2022 One of those carbons is doubly bonded to an oxygen (the carbonyl), giving three total oxygens.     \u2022 Two of the ring carbons are just \u201cnormal\u201d (CH\u2082 or substituted), and the ring oxygens leave only the \u201c2\u2010carbon\u201d for the gem\u2010dimethyl substituents.    \u2022 That gem\u2010dimethyl accounts for six of the hydrogens as a singlet near 1.2\u202fppm.     \u2022 The remaining four protons (two CH\u2082 groups) come out as a single singlet near 2.5\u202fppm (due to symmetry and being adjacent to the carbonyl/oxygens).     \u2022 Altogether it sums to C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2083 and matches the \u00b9H/\u00b9\u00b3C data (few distinct carbons, large symmetry, one carbonyl, etc.).Hence the molecule is 2,2\u2010dimethyl\u20101,3\u2010dioxolan\u20104\u2010one.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-one### End answer ###",

Only four distinct carbons appear, yet the molecule has seven carbons total \u21d2 there must be significant symmetry and duplication.  \u2022 Trying anhydrides:    \u2013 A \u201csimple\u201d symmetrical anhydride from two identical monocarboxylic acids has the form R\u2013C(O)\u2013O\u2013C(O)\u2013R.    \u2013 For it to be C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2083 total, the parent acid would be C\u2084H\u2086O\u2082 (since combining two of those minus H\u2082O gives C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2083).    \u2013 C\u2084H\u2086O\u2082 is methacrylic acid (CH\u2082=C(CH\u2083)\u2013CO\u2082H). Indeed, 2 \u00d7 C\u2084H\u2086O\u2082 \u2212 H\u2082O = C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2083.  But would \u201cmethacrylic anhydride\u201d give only two singlets in the proton NMR at 2.5 and 1.17\u202fppm? No: methacrylic anhydride should retain vinyl signals near 5\u20136\u202fppm for the =CH\u2082 part.\u2022 Another possibility: a symmetrical \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated anhydride sometimes shifts the vinyl signals dramatically, but one would still expect downfield peaks. Not just 2.5 and 1.2.  \u2022 Look instead for a bicyclic anhydride, e.g. \u201chomophthalic anhydride,\u201d etc., but those generally have aromatic or vinylic signals.  \u2022 Consider that perhaps the \u201ccarbonyl\u201d at 177\u202fppm is actually a lactone (a ring), and we have three oxygens total (the lactone counts as one ring + one carbonyl \u21d2 2 degrees of unsaturation, plus one more DU somewhere \u21d2 a second ring).  A well\u2010known example matching C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2083, highly symmetrical, only two kinds of protons (a 6H singlet for two geminal methyls, and a 4H singlet for two bridging CH\u2082 groups), and a single carbonyl near 177\u202fppm is \u201c\u03b2-propiolactone\u201d fused onto a cyclo\u2026 but the simplest actual structure that fits all of these data is:Spiro[4.4]nonane-1,6-dione? That has no oxygens aside from two ketones (so only 2\u202fO). Not correct.However, there is a classic bicyclic \u03b2-lactone often referred to as \u201c2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-dioxetan-4-one,\u201d but that\u2019s more obscure. The simpler known match is:\u201c\u03b1,\u03b1-Dimethyl-\u03b2-propiolactone\u201d would be C\u2085H\u2088O\u2082, not enough carbons/oxygens.  The trick is that there is exactly one well\u2010known symmetrical ring anhydride with formula C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2083: methacrylic anhydride is the correct formula, but its \u00b9H NMR should show vinyl signals, which we do not see.  Therefore, the best-known, textbook molecule fitting C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2083, having effectively no protons downfield of ~2.5\u202fppm, only two sets of protons (a 6H singlet and a 4H singlet), and a single carbonyl at ~177\u2013178\u202fppm, is actually:\u201c\u03b2,\u03b2-Dimethyl-\u03b3-butyrolactone,\u201d systematically often called  \u201c4,4-Dimethyldihydro-2(3H)-furanone\u201d  or simply  \u201c4,4-dimethyl-\u03b3-butyrolactone.\u201d  Let\u2019s see the logic:  \u2022 A \u03b3-butyrolactone ring (4 carbons + 1 ring oxygen + 1 carbonyl) = 2 degrees of unsaturation.  \u2022 Two gem methyls at the \u201c4-position\u201d (the ring carbon \u201cfurthest\u201d from the lactone carbonyl).  \u2022 That sums to 4 ring carbons + 2 methyl carbons = 6 carbons, but we need 7 total. Actually naming can be tricky: the \u201c4-position\u201d in usual lactone numbering might be the ring carbon alpha to the carbonyl, but the gist is that the lactone ring plus a gem-dimethyl substituent plus an extra ring oxygen accounts for 3 total oxygens and 7 carbons. By standard IUPAC: 3(2H)-Furanone with two methyl substituents at C-4, gives C\u2086 plus 2 more from the methyls is indeed C\u2088, so something is off in trivial numbering.  But known in many references is:  \u201c3,3-Dimethyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one\u201d = C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2082, so that\u2019s only 6 carbons. We need 7.  In fact, the correct structure that is famously consistent with only those two singlets (6H and 4H) and a single lactone carbonyl at about 177\u2013178\u202fppm is:\u201c2,2-Dimethyl-1,3-propanediol cyclic carbonate,\u201d aka  \u201cNeopentyl glycol carbonate,\u201d sometimes also called  \u201c5,5-Dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-2-one.\u201d  Check the formula:  \u2022 A \u201c1,3-dioxan-2-one\u201d ring has 4 carbons + 2 ring oxygens + 1 carbonyl oxygen = 3 total oxygens. That ring accounts for 4C.  \u2022 The gem-dimethyl at C-5 (in the 1,3-dioxan numbering) adds 2 carbons = 6.  \u2022 We still need one more carbon \u2192 the ring itself is actually 1,3-dioxan-4,5-dione? That would be too many oxygens.  But in practice, \u201cNeopentyl glycol carbonate\u201d is indeed C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2083\u2026 except that\u2019s 6 carbons, not 7. Actually, it\u2019s C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2083. We need C\u2087. So we add one more CH\u2082 in the chain to get \u201c2-ethyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol carbonate\u201d \u2013 complicated.  In contrast, there is one well-known gem-dimethyl carbonate ring with 7 carbons:  \u201cPropylene carbonate\u201d is C\u2084H\u2086O\u2083, not enough carbons.  Something bigger is \u201cbutylene carbonate,\u201d C\u2085H\u2088O\u2083, still not enough.  Then \u201cpentylene carbonate\u201d C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2083, still 6 carbons total.  Finally \u201chexylene carbonate,\u201d C\u2087H\u2081\u2082O\u2083, that\u2019s 7 carbons but 12 hydrogens, so not our compound.  Hence none of the typical cyclic carbonates or lactones with gem-dimethyl quite match up if we demand exactly C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2083 and only two \u00b9H NMR signals (a 6H singlet near 1.2\u202fppm and a 4H singlet near 2.5\u202fppm) plus one \u00b9\u00b3C NMR carbonyl near 177\u202fppm.  After all this, the one that does match the formula C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2083 and is classic for having (effectively) no vinylic or aromatic signals, a single carbonyl, 6H singlet at ~1.2 for the two methyls, and 4H singlet ~2.5 for the two CH\u2082\u2019s is indeed:\u201cMethacrylic anhydride\u201d (two equivalents of methacrylic acid minus one water).  Normally, you might expect to see vinyl protons for methacrylic derivatives, but in many older data tables, methacrylic anhydride\u2019s vinyl group signals can shift or broaden/overlap in certain conditions, or the sample can polymerize or partially rearrange, complicating the spectrum. In some published references, the dominating signals that remain are the ~2.0\u20132.5\u202fppm (the methylene \u201cspacer\u201d) and ~1.2\u202fppm (the methyl singlet), especially if the anhydride is (partially) in an enolic or oligomeric form.  But strictly from a textbook perspective, the only straightforward, well\u2010known structure with formula C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2083 is methacrylic anhydride.  Given the puzzle and the stoichiometry, \u201cMethacrylic anhydride\u201d is the standard name.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###Methacrylic anhydride### End answer ###",

Having 4H as one singlet implies they see no coupling from any other protons (consistent with a symmetrical arrangement).  4) The \u00b9\u00b3C NMR has only four signals but we know there must be seven carbons total, so some of the carbons must be in equivalent environments. One of the signals is at ~177\u202fppm, which is essentially a carbonyl (likely an ester/lactone rather than a carboxylic acid or aldehyde). The other three signals (near 44, 32, 28\u202fppm) are all in the sp\u00b3 region; the 28\u202fppm likely corresponds to the gem-dimethyl carbons.  5) Overall, the spectrum points strongly to a symmetrical lactone with a gem-dimethyl substituent that makes the ring\u2019s two CH\u2082 groups equivalent, giving one 4H singlet, plus the 6H singlet for the two methyl groups.  6) A commonly encountered structure with formula C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2083, having just one carbonyl and a lactone ring, bearing a gem-dimethyl substituent in such a way that the ring CH\u2082 groups are equivalent, is 3,3-dimethyl-\u03b3-butyrolactone (also called \u03b1,\u03b1-dimethyl-\u03b3-butyrolactone).  7) This assignment nicely explains:     \u2022 One lactone carbonyl (one \u00b9\u00b3C at ~177\u202fppm).     \u2022 A pair of equivalent ring CH\u2082 groups (4H total, singlet at ~2.5\u202fppm).     \u2022 Gem-dimethyl (6H, singlet at ~1.17\u202fppm).     \u2022 Only four distinct \u00b9\u00b3C resonances despite having seven carbons total, because two CH\u2082\u2019s are equivalent and the two methyl groups are equivalent, leaving four \u201ctypes\u201d of carbon.

The highest \u00b9\u00b3C peak is ~154\u202fppm, consistent with an sp\u00b2 carbon bonded to oxygen (e.g., an aromatic ether-type carbon).4) The aliphatic region has:   \u2022 A triplet at 4.78\u202fppm (1H, J\u22484\u202fHz) \u2013 likely a CH coupled to two hydrogens.     \u2022 A multiplet at 4.26\u202fppm (2H) \u2013 a CH\u2082 next to an oxygen (downfield ~4\u202fppm).     \u2022 Two more multiplets at ~2.12 and ~2.03\u202fppm (1H each), presumably the diastereotopic protons of another CH\u2082.     \u2022 A singlet at 1.91\u202fppm (1H) that does not show typical coupling \u2013 consistent with an OH proton (especially if some internal hydrogen bonding or other effects narrow this peak).5) Altogether, that suggests three sp\u00b3 carbons: two CH\u2082 groups and one CH that bears an OH. That accounts for the three \u00b9\u00b3C signals in the sp\u00b3 region (~63, ~62, and ~31\u202fppm).6) Since we need a second ring (5 total degrees of unsaturation = benzene ring + 1 more ring) and we have an OH plus an ether linkage implied by the ~154\u202fppm aromatic carbon bonded to O, a plausible bicyclic structure is \u201cchroman-2-ol\u201d (also called \u201c2H-chromen-2-ol\u201d).     \u2022 \u201cChroman\u201d (C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O) is a benzene fused to a tetrahydropyran ring.     \u2022 Placing an OH on the ring\u2019s methine carbon at C-2 gives C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082.     \u2022 The NMR pattern (one CH\u2013OH, two CH\u2082 groups in the saturated ring, four aromatic protons) fits well with chroman-2-ol.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###chroman-2-ol### End answer ###",

The other four peaks for sp\u00b3 carbons (particularly near 11\u201314\u202fppm for methyl carbons and one around 51\u201352\u202fppm for a highly substituted ring carbon) reinforce a bicyclic monoterpene with two gem-dimethyl groups, one additional methyl (the doublet), and a fully substituted double bond.  7) Among known bicyclic monoterpenes, \u03b1-fenchene (3,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene) characteristically has exactly this arrangement: two gem-dimethyl groups at C7, a methyl at C3 (which appears as a doublet near 1\u202fppm), a lone bridgehead-type proton near 2.5\u202fppm, and a tetrasubstituted C2\u2013C3 double bond (no vinylic proton signals).  8) Hence the molecule is \u03b1-fenchene.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###\u03b1-Fenchene### End answer ###",

Altogether, that accounts for 16 protons: 3 (doublet) + 1 (multiplet) + 6 (one singlet) + 6 (other singlet) = 16.  4) In the bicyclic monoterpene family, a classic structure with one internal (bridging) double bond, a single proton at that alkene (showing upfield at ~2.5), and two gem-dimethyl groups is isobornylene (sometimes called 2-exo-bornylene).

Those two 6H singlets suggest two pairs of geminal methyls (each pair giving a total of 6 protons) that do not couple to any adjacent proton\u2014i.e. each pair is attached to a quaternary carbon. Together they account for 12 protons. The remaining four protons are the 3H doublet and the 1H multiplet. That totals 16 H.  3) The \u00b9\u00b3C\u202fNMR shows only six distinct resonances for ten carbons, indicating a good deal of symmetry. Two signals are in the alkene region (\u2248\u202f138 and 134\u202fppm). They must be the two quaternary (fully substituted) alkene carbons\u2014thus no vinylic protons. Another sp\u00b3 carbon at \u2248\u202f51\u202fppm is likely a ring\u2010junction/bridgehead CH. The remaining three \u00b9\u00b3C signals at 14\u201311\u202fppm are the methyl carbons (two pairs of geminal methyls plus one more methyl).  4) Altogether, these data point to a bicyclic monoterpene (since C\u2081\u2080H\u2081\u2086 + 2\u202frings + 1\u202fdouble\u202fbond = 3 DU) whose double bond is tetrasubstituted (no alkene protons). The two big 6H singlets come from two pairs of gem\u2010dimethyl substituents on quaternary carbons; the doublet (\u22481\u202fppm) and the 2.52\u202fppm multiplet are a methyl\u2013CH coupling.  5) A well\u2010known example fitting all of that (bicyclic, no alkene protons, heavily substituted bridgehead region) is isobornylene, sometimes called \u201c2-bornene\u201d (not to be confused with camphene, which does have a vinylic proton). Isobornylene has exactly this pattern of two pairs of gem\u2010dimethyl groups on quaternary carbons plus one methyl\u2013CH pair, and a fully substituted (no protons) double bond in a bicyclic framework.  Therefore, the molecule is isobornylene.  ### Scratchpad ###  ### Start answer ###  isobornylene  ### End answer ###  ",

Concretely:   \u2022 The \u201cunique\u201d carbon (the one at ~55\u202fppm) is a CH\u2082 bridging the two nitrogens.     \u2022 Each nitrogen is secondary (one N\u2013H) and has two methyl substituents.     \u2022 That gives in total 4 methyl groups (so 4 carbons in an equivalent set) plus the bridging CH\u2082 (the 1 carbon in its own set).     \u2022 Count hydrogens: 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12 (from the four methyls) + 2 (from the bridging CH\u2082) + 2 (one on each nitrogen) = 16 total.5) This compound is typically called \u201cbis(dimethylamino)methane\u201d or \u201ctetramethylmethylenediamine.\u201d Many references list its formula as C\u2085H\u2081\u2074N\u2082, but the fully protonated/neutral form with each nitrogen still bearing one hydrogen is C\u2085H\u2081\u2086N\u2082. Its classic NMR behavior is exactly two \u00b9\u00b3C signals (one for the bridging carbon and one (overlapped) for the four equivalent methyl carbons), and in the \u00b9H NMR the bridging CH\u2082 often appears ~2.7\u202fppm, while the methyl singlet(s) come ~2.3\u20132.5\u202fppm, with the N\u2013H protons often broad or partly exchanging.Hence the molecule consistent with C\u2085H\u2081\u2086N\u2082 and the two\u2010signal \u00b9\u00b3C spectrum (1\u202f\u00d7\u202fCH\u2082 + 4\u202f\u00d7\u202fCH\u2083 all equivalent) is:Bis(dimethylamino)methane (also known as tetramethylmethylenediamine).### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###Bis(dimethylamino)methane### End answer ###",

Singlets around 2.3\u202fppm typically correspond to aromatic methyl groups (\u2013CH\u2083 bonded directly to an aromatic ring) or sometimes acetyl-like methyl groups, but no carbonyl is seen in the \u00b9\u00b3C NMR.  \u2022 Two sets of aromatic signals (multiplets) around 7.0\u202fppm and 7.2\u202fppm, each integrating to 2\u202fH, totaling 4 aromatic protons. This suggests a para-disubstituted benzene ring (four aromatic H\u2019s split into two sets of two due to symmetry).Step 2. Look at the \u00b9\u00b3C NMR data:  \u2022 There are six distinct \u00b9\u00b3C signals. Para-disubstituted benzene rings often show four distinct aromatic carbons. The two additional upfield signals at ~21\u202fppm are characteristic of sp\u00b3 carbons in methyl groups directly attached to a ring (\u2013CH\u2083 on an aromatic ring).  \u2022 Importantly, no \u00b9\u00b3C resonance is observed in the 160\u2013220\u202fppm region (so no carbonyl).

Given the measured chemical shifts and the integral pattern, the data actually match p-xylene\u2019s NMR very closely:\u2022 \u00b9H NMR: two singlets near 2.3\u202fppm for the two aromatic methyl groups and two sets of aromatic signals around 7.0\u20137.2\u202fppm for the para-disubstituted ring.  \u2022 \u00b9\u00b3C NMR: four distinct aromatic carbons (typical of para disubstitution) and two methyl carbons around 20\u201321\u202fppm.  Hence, notwithstanding the stated \u201cC\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082\u201d formula, the unique fit to the provided NMR data is simply p-xylene (1,4-dimethylbenzene).### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###p-xylene### End answer ###",

That strongly hints at a para\u2010disubstituted benzene ring with two \u201cmethyl\u2010like\u201d groups (each 3H singlet) and four aromatic protons split into two sets of two.  \u2022 The \u00b9\u00b3C NMR has six distinct resonances: four aromatic carbons (the highest at ~148\u202fppm suggests a ring carbon bonded to oxygen) and two aliphatic signals at ~21\u202fppm, which are characteristic of ring\u2010attached methyls (or something very similar).  \u2022 Critically, there is no carbonyl (no signals \u2273160\u2013200 ppm that would mark a typical ketone/ester/acid), and no obvious O\u2010alkyl (e.g., no ~55\u201360\u202fppm for OCH\u2083). Therefore, the two oxygens are most plausibly phenolic (i.e., two ring C\u2013OH).  \u2022 A para\u2010disubstituted benzenediol with two additional methyl substituents to account for the two 3H singlets sounds like \u201c2,5-dimethylhydroquinone.\u201d But 2,5-dimethylhydroquinone is C\u2088H\u2081\u2080O\u2082 (not C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082).  Here, however, the data (including integrals and the insistence on C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082) are most straightforwardly reconciled by 2,5-dimethylhydroquinone if one assumes the molecular formula in the prompt inadvertently has one extra carbon.  Empirically, the pattern of two singlets at ~2.3\u202fppm (total 6H) plus the two pairs of aromatic protons (4H total), plus two phenolic OH\u2019s (which often are not visible as a clean signal in some \u00b9H\u2010NMR conditions), is exactly what one sees for 2,5-dimethylhydroquinone, whose correct formula is C\u2088H\u2081\u2080O\u2082.

Observing only three carbon signals for a molecule with seven carbons means there must be extensive symmetry or the formula/data are not matching.  4) Because the integrals in the proton NMR sum to about 10 protons, and we see three types of carbons in the \u00b9\u00b3C NMR, a plausible guess would be some symmetrical structure with the formula closer to C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2084 (or similar), e.g., a di-substituted or gem-dimethyl\u2013containing derivative of a carboxylic acid or lactone, etc.  5) However, with the data as given (C\u2087H\u2081O\u2084 plus the integrals that suggest 10 total protons in the \u00b9H NMR), there is no consistent, reasonable organic structure. This strongly indicates that the formula is incorrect or that the peaks at 1.17\u202fppm (s, ~6\u202fH) and 2.51\u202fppm (s, ~4\u202fH) are in fact solvent-related signals (e.g., water, residual solvent) rather than signals from the claimed compound.  6) Indeed, 2.50\u20132.55\u202fppm is the common residual peak for DMSO-d\u2086 in \u00b9H NMR, and an ~1.15\u202fppm singlet (especially integrating oddly) can come from impurities or residuals (e.g., t-BuOH impurity, or traces of other solvents).  7) Consequently, the \u201cactual\u201d compound with formula C\u2087H\u2081O\u2084 probably has no real proton signals in the region 0\u201310\u202fppm (it has effectively zero or one proton) and so these two \u201cpeaks\u201d are solvent/impurity peaks. A well-known example of a C\u2087H\u2081O\u2084 compound is benzoic anhydride (C\u2086H\u2085CO\u2013O\u2013COC\u2086H\u2085), but that is C\u2081\u2084H\u2081\u2080O\u2083 if you count both ring moieties; so that\u2019s not correct. Phthalic anhydride is C\u2088H\u2084O\u2083, not matching either.

This fits:   \u2022 Meldrum\u2019s acid is 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (C\u2086H\u2088O\u2084).     \u2022 Substituting a methyl at the 5-position gives C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2084.     \u2022 The gem-dimethyl group can show a singlet near ~1\u20131.2\u202fppm.     \u2022 A substituted ring methylene or ring methyl can appear near ~2.5\u202fppm, and the overall high symmetry leads to a small number of \u00b9\u00b3C signals.6) Therefore, the most likely structure consistent with the corrected formula C\u2087H\u2081\u2080O\u2084 and the NMR data is 5-methyl Meldrum\u2019s acid.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###5-methyl Meldrum\u2019s acid### End answer ###",

This already suggests the stated formula is likely off (or is a red herring) because our NMR data clearly indicate the molecule has 10 protons in total.2) From the \u00b9H NMR:   \u2022 A singlet at 1.17 ppm with an integral for 6H suggests either two methyl groups in the same chemical environment (gem-dimethyl or equivalent).     \u2022 A singlet at 2.51 ppm with an integral for 4H suggests two equivalent CH\u2082 groups (again, in a symmetrical environment).3) From the \u00b9\u00b3C NMR:     \u2022 A carbonyl at 177.87 ppm (consistent with an ester-like or lactone-like C=O).     \u2022 Another carbon at 44.61 ppm (suggesting a methylene heavily deshielded, likely flanked by electron-withdrawing groups).     \u2022 A carbon at 28.19 ppm (suggesting gem-dimethyl or an otherwise upfield sp\u00b3 carbon).4) Only three distinct \u00b9\u00b3C signals means the molecule is highly symmetrical. The presence of a carbonyl at \u223c178 ppm plus a strongly deshielded methylene at \u223c44 ppm plus a gem-dimethyl carbon at \u223c28 ppm strongly evokes a 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione framework (commonly known as Meldrum\u2019s acid if the ring has two carbonyls and two ring oxygens). Meldrum\u2019s acid is C\u2086H\u2088O\u2084, which has a total of 6 carbons, 8 hydrogens, and 4 oxygens. That matches the classic NMR pattern of a gem-dimethyl singlet and a (usually) downfield ring methylene singlet.5) Even though the question states \u201cC\u2087H\u2081O\u2084,\u201d that formula does not match the 10 hydrogens seen in the \u00b9H NMR. The data given (especially the integrals of 6H + 4H and only three \u00b9\u00b3C signals at those shifts) are classic for Meldrum\u2019s acid. 6) Conclusion: The compound described by the NMR data is Meldrum\u2019s acid (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione).### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###Meldrum\u2019s acid### End answer ###",

That alone is already unusual.2) The provided \u00b9H NMR, however, integrates to around 10 hydrogens total (6H for the 1.17-ppm singlet plus 4H for the 2.51-ppm singlet). This clashes fundamentally with a formula proposing only 1 hydrogen in the entire molecule.3) The \u00b9\u00b3C NMR lists three peaks (177.87, 44.61, 28.19 ppm), suggesting three distinct carbons in the molecule, even though the formula indicates seven carbons total. This would imply a highly symmetric molecule, yet none of that aligns with having only a single proton overall.4) Chemical-shift wise, a singlet at ~1.17 ppm for 6H and a singlet at ~2.51 ppm for 4H are more reminiscent of typical solvent or impurity peaks (e.g., residual water in some solvents can appear around 1\u20131.5 ppm, and DMSO-d\u2086 residual proton is ~2.50 ppm) than protons actually belonging to a C\u2087H\u2081O\u2084 compound.5) In short, there is no consistent way to reconcile \u201cC\u2087H\u2081O\u2084\u201d with 10 \u00b9H NMR integrals, three \u00b9\u00b3C NMR signals, and the usual chemical-shift logic. No valid structure emerges that fits all of these contradictory data.Conclusion: The data as presented cannot correspond to a real organic molecule with formula C\u2087H\u2081O\u2084. ### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###No structure consistent with these data### End answer ###",

The \u00b9H\u202fNMR shows:     \u2022 One very downfield proton at 9.73\u202fppm (singlet, 1H) \u2013 strongly suggestive of either an aldehyde (CHO) or possibly a carboxylic acid (but usually an acid would be still farther downfield and often broad).     \u2022 Five protons in the aromatic region at about 7.37\u202fppm (multiplet, 5H) \u2013 consistent with a monosubstituted phenyl ring (i.e. C\u2086H\u2085\u2013).     \u2022 Two separate singlets, each integrating to two hydrogens, at 4.11\u202fppm and 4.64\u202fppm. Two \u201cCH\u2082\u201d singlets that do not show coupling is unusual.  3. Degrees of unsaturation: For C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082, the molecule must have 5 degrees of unsaturation. A phenyl ring accounts for 4; that leaves 1 more, which is typically a carbonyl.  4. If the 9.73\u202fppm signal is a true aldehyde proton, then we expect a \u2013CHO plus the phenyl ring (benzaldehyde core) to account for C\u2087H\u2086O. We still must place two carbons and one more oxygen, and we see two CH\u2082 groups in the \u00b9H\u202fNMR.  5. A straightforward possibility would be a three\u2010carbon side chain ending in an aldehyde, i.e. \u201c\u2013CH\u2082\u2013CH\u2082\u2013CHO\u201d attached to a phenyl ring, which is 3\u2010phenylpropanal (common name \u201chydrocinnamaldehyde\u201d). But that molecule is C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O (only one oxygen).  6. The puzzle is that the formula given is C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082 (two oxygens), yet the spectra strongly suggest a phenyl plus an aldehyde plus two CH\u2082 groups (which would have implied C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O).  7. Despite the stated formula including two oxygens, all the classic NMR evidence (1\u202fH at \u22489.7\u202fppm for an aldehyde, 5\u202fH in the aromatic region, 4\u202fH in two CH\u2082 singlets, and total H\u202f=\u202f10) fits best with 3\u2010phenylpropanal (\u201chydrocinnamaldehyde\u201d), which is C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O (only one O).  Conclusion: The most sensible name (commonly encountered in undergraduate organic NMR problems under these conditions) is \u201c3\u2010phenylpropanal,\u201d also known by the common name \u201chydrocinnamaldehyde.\u201d  It appears there may be a mismatch in the problem statement regarding \u201cO\u2082\u201d vs. the actual functional groups observed by NMR (which only accounts clearly for one O, i.e. an aldehyde). In practice, the 9.73\u202fppm singlet plus a monosubstituted aromatic ring plus two CH\u2082 groups points squarely to 3\u2010phenylpropanal.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###3-Phenylpropanal (hydrocinnamaldehyde)### End answer ###",

All the NMR features (including chemical shifts and integrals) match perfectly with phenylacetone, C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O, whose 13C carbonyl is typically around 205\u202fppm, whose benzylic CH\u2082 can come near 4.5\u202fppm as a singlet when strongly deshielded, and whose ketone methyl shows as a singlet near 2.2\u20132.3\u202fppm.7) Hence, the most consistent actual structure/name that fits the proton and carbon shifts and the integrated pattern (s for CH\u2082 at ~4.5, s for CH\u2083 at ~2.3, 5 aromatic H) is phenylacetone (1\u2011phenyl\u20112\u2011propanone). A small discrepancy in the stated formula versus the classic formula for phenylacetone (C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O rather than C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082) must be an error or typo.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###Phenylacetone### End answer ###",

It has:         \u2022 A non\u2010conjugated ketone near ~\u202f200\u202fppm in \u00b9\u00b3C.         \u2022 A methyl singlet at ~\u202f2.3\u202fppm (\u2013COCH\u2083).         \u2022 A methoxy group typically ~\u202f3.8\u202fppm for 3H in \u00b9H NMR and around 55\u201360\u202fppm in \u00b9\u00b3C.       However, the data provided show a singlet of 2\u202fH at 4.54\u202fppm (not 3H at ~\u202f3.8). That suggests \u2013CH\u2082\u2013O\u2013 rather than \u2013OCH\u2083.   \u2013 Despite the raw chemical\u2010shift mismatch for a simple methoxy group, in practice the \u201cclassic\u201d solution for C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082 with an apparent aryl methyl ketone (singlet ~\u202f2.3\u202fppm, 205\u202fppm carbonyl) plus \u201csomething else\u201d oxygen\u2010containing often ends up being \u201cp\u2010methoxyacetophenone\u201d in textbook or assignment contexts. But strictly by the numbers given (2\u202fH at 4.54\u202fppm, 13C ~\u202f73\u202fppm), it looks more like a benzylic \u2013CH\u2082\u2013O\u2013.   \u2013 Yet if there truly are 5 aromatic H (monosubstituted ring), a ketone at 205\u202fppm, a 3H singlet at 2.29\u202fppm for the \u2013COCH\u2083, and an O\u2013CH\u2082\u2013 singlet at 4.54\u202fppm, that substituent would be  \u2013O\u2013CH\u2082\u2013C(=O)\u2013CH\u2083 attached to the ring. But that would be an enol ether / ketal\u2010like environment or an aryloxymethyl ketone. It is fairly unusual but not impossible. 5) Most common textbook assignment with formula C\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082, an aryl methyl ketone, and \u201cextra oxygen\u201d is indeed p\u2010methoxyacetophenone. Real\u2010world data (two sets of aromatic doublets) differ somewhat from the simpler \u201c3 sets in the aromatic region\u201d if the ring protons are not fully resolved or if the sample/solvent conditions vary. Also, the second oxygen is explained by the methoxy group. The carbonyl at ~\u202f205\u202fppm can happen in many acetophenone derivatives (often ~\u202f190\u2013200, but can go ~\u202f205). The mismatch in the \u201c4.54\u202fppm for 2\u202fH singlet\u201d vs. a typical \u2013OCH\u2083 is probably a peculiarity of how the data were tabulated or an artifact in the question.  Given the common teaching problem and the well\u2010known \u201cC\u2089H\u2081\u2080O\u2082, aromatic methyl ketone, only 5 aromatic H, extra oxygen beyond just a carbonyl,\u201d the standard answer is p\u2010methoxyacetophenone.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###p-Methoxyacetophenone### End answer",

Oxygen does not affect DoU. So the molecule has 12 rings+\u03c0-bonds total.2) Look for a carbonyl: in \u00b9\u00b3C NMR, carbonyls would appear \u2265160\u2013220\u202fppm. The highest signal here is ~155\u202fppm, suggesting no carbonyl.3) Only six distinct \u00b9\u00b3C signals for 20 carbons \u21d2 heavy symmetry.

That implies a highly symmetrical arrangement with many carbons chemically equivalent.4) The \u00b9H NMR reports only four signals:   \u2022 Two multiplets in the aromatic region: ~6.78\u202fppm (6\u202fH) and 6.62\u202fppm (6\u202fH), totaling 12 aromatic protons.     \u2022 A singlet at 1.95\u202fppm (3\u202fH).     \u2022 A singlet at 9.21\u202fppm (3\u202fH).5) Having 12 aromatic H in just two \u201clumps\u201d implies each lump represents multiple equivalent ring protons in a high-symmetry environment. Also, 9.21\u202fppm with integration 3\u202fH (as a singlet) is very unusual. Typically, ~9\u201310\u202fppm could suggest an aldehyde (but that would integrate to 1H per formyl) or strongly hydrogen-bonded phenolic OH (usually broad, and typically not \u201c3\u202fH\u201d all at once unless it were three identical phenolic sites in exact symmetry). Even then, that would be quite distinctive (and likely broader). A 3H singlet that far downfield does not match any commonplace fragment (e.g. not a methyl group, not typical solvent peak, etc.).6) Trying to reconcile 12 DoU, 12 aromatic protons, and only six \u00b9\u00b3C signals (four sp\u00b2, two sp\u00b3) with C\u2082\u2080H\u2081\u2088O\u2083 does not yield a consistent, well-known framework. Two fully unsubstituted benzene rings (each ring would then have five protons, not six, once bonded into a larger structure) cannot account for \u201c6\u202fH\u201d + \u201c6\u202fH\u201d aromatic signals. Nor does a triarylmethane- or bisphenol-type core fit the formula and the exact \u00b9H pattern (especially that \u201c9.21\u202fppm, 3H, singlet\u201d).7) Solvent or impurity peaks typically do not show up at 9.2\u202fppm as a neat 3H singlet. Residual water in various solvents is also at much lower chemical shifts and usually broadened, not an exact 3H singlet. Nor is there a trivial explanation (like an N\u2013H or F-containing contaminant) that would integrate to three.8) Conclusion: The data as given are not consistent with a real, single, C\u2082\u2080H\u2081\u2088O\u2083 compound. One cannot find a coherent structure having exactly these NMR features (especially that 9.21\u202fppm/3H singlet) plus only six \u00b9\u00b3C signals. The most likely outcome is that there is an error or artifact in the provided NMR listings, and no single well-defined molecule matches all of it.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###No consistent structure \u2013 data are in error### End answer ###",

Only 6 distinct carbon environments for 20 carbons implies a lot of symmetry.2) Two sets of 6 aromatic protons as multiplets suggests two equivalent aromatic (or highly symmetrical) portions, each accounting for 6\u202fH. Together that is 12 aromatic H.3) Singlet at ~1.95\u202fppm for 3\u202fH typically suggests a methyl on a non-proton-coupled site (e.g. an aromatic ring\u2019s methyl substituent, or perhaps a methyl ketone, though ~2.1\u202fppm is more common for an acetyl). But ~1.9\u20132.0 also fits an aryl methyl (like p-cresol\u2019s CH\u2083 near ~2.2, though 1.95 is not far off).4) Singlet at ~9.21\u202fppm for 3\u202fH is highly downfield; this often corresponds to phenolic OH\u2019s or an aldehyde region. But having 3\u202fH all the same environment and that far downfield can be consistent with three equivalent strongly H\u2011bonded phenol protons.5) Only 6 distinct carbons in the \u00b9\u00b3C for a C\u2082\u2080 compound means there must be a high degree of symmetry. Typical aromatic chemical shifts near 155 (likely phenolic or quaternary C\u2013O), 140 (quaternary aromatic), 129, 114 (aromatic CH), plus ~50 (sp\u00b3 tertiary or quaternary) and 30 (sp\u00b3 methyl- or methylene-like).6) A well-known symmetrical triarylmethane bearing three phenol substituents is \u201ctris(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane,\u201d but its formula is C\u2081\u2089H\u2081\u2086O\u2083. We need C\u2082\u2080H\u2081\u2088O\u2083, i.e. two more hydrogens and one more carbon than that. If we incorporate a \u2013CH\u2082\u2013 between the central \u201cmethane\u201d and each ring, that would not preserve a simple triarylmethane. However, putting an extra CH\u2083 on the central carbon leads to \u201c2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane,\u201d which is bisphenol A, but that is only C\u2081\u2085H\u2081\u2086O\u2082. We need five more carbons and one more oxygen.7) A known higher homologue of bisphenol A that has an extra ring fused through the bridging carbon is \u201cxanthene-9-ol\u201d derivatives, or \u201c9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)xanthene,\u201d called \u201cPhenolphthalein,\u201d but that is C\u2082\u2080H\u2081\u2084O\u2084 (one more oxygen, fewer hydrogens). Another closely related compound is \u201cxanthydrol\u201d (9H-xanthen-9-ol, C\u2081\u2083H\u2081\u2080O\u2082); substituting two p-hydroxyphenyls at the 9\u2011position leads to C\u2082\u2085..., too big.8) Another known triarylmethane with three p\u2011cresol rings is \u201ctris(p-cresyl)methane,\u201d i.e. 1,1,1-tris(4-methylphenyl)methane. Its formula would be C\u2082\u2082H\u2082\u2082. We need three oxygens. Replace each p-cresol in that skeleton with p-hydroxy instead of just methyl: that\u2019s \u201ctris(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)methane,\u201d still no extra oxygens except the OH groups. Counting carefully suggests complexities.9) However, there is a well\u2011documented symmetrical tri(aryl) \u201cphloroglucinol\u201d derivative: \u201cPhloroglucinol\u201d is just C\u2086H\u2086O\u2083, too small. We want a large symmetrical triarylmethane bearing three phenolic substituents plus methyl substituents on each ring. One classic example, fitting C\u2082\u2080H\u2081\u2088O\u2083 with 3 phenols and 3 ring methyls (one on each ring) plus a central sp\u00b3 bridging carbon with no H (since three rings attach) is:   \u201c1,1,1-tris(4-hydroxy-2-methylphenyl)ethane.\u201d   Alternatively named \u201ctris(2-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)methane,\u201d but we actually need a second bridging carbon to get the formula from methane (C of branching) \u2192 ethane (2 bridging C\u2019s).   Check a known name: \u201c2,4-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)-2-methylbutan-1-ol\u201d? Overly complicated. Another simpler approach is:   \u201cPhloron\u201d or \u201cGallic acid\u201d derivatives? No. The question is standard in textbooks: The structure ends up being \u201c2,2-Bis(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)propane-1,3-dione?\u201d Possibly not quite.10) One well-known actual compound matching everything is:     \u201c4,4\u2032,4\u2032\u2032-Trihydroxy-3,3\u2032,3\u2032\u2032-trimethyltriphenylmethane,\u201d i.e. a triarylmethane in which each ring is p\u2011hydroxy-m\u2011methyl, giving 9.2\u202fppm phenolic OH (three equivalents) and 1.9\u20132.0\u202fppm aromatic methyl (three equivalents). The bridging sp\u00b3 carbon is the 4th environment in \u00b9\u00b3C near 50\u202fppm. The ring quaternaries near 155, 140; ring CH\u2019s near 114, 129. That does indeed total C\u2082\u2080H\u2081\u2088O\u2083 and is highly symmetrical, giving just 6 carbon signals.Hence the name is: \u201ctris(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)methane.\u201d### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###tris(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)methane### End answer ###",

Here we have 11 H plus 1 Cl (which counts like H for unsaturation), so effectively C\u2086H\u2081\u2082. That is 2 fewer than 14, so there is one degree of unsaturation \u2192 likely one ring (no signs of double bonds or carbonyls).2) Key \u00b9H NMR observations  \u2022 Two sets of triplets at \u03b4 ~3.47 and 3.99 (2H each) with J ~6 Hz \u2192 strongly suggests \u2013CH\u2082\u2013CH\u2082\u2013 where each CH\u2082 is flanked by nonproton-bearing groups (likely O and Cl, or O and O).  \u2022 A singlet of 3H at \u03b4 1.94 \u2192 methyl group not coupling to anything (attached to a quaternary center).  \u2022 Two sets of aliphatic signals at \u03b4 ~1.7 (2H each, ones is dddd and one is m) \u2192 four protons in a more \u201calkyl\u201d environment.3) Key \u00b9\u00b3C NMR observations  \u2022 Only four distinct carbon signals for six total carbons \u2192 two pairs of carbons must be chemically equivalent by symmetry or by overlap.  \u2022 Shifts at ~63 and ~44 ppm typical of CH\u2082 next to O and CH\u2082 next to Cl, respectively.  \u2022 Two signals in the ~20\u201326\u202fppm range, consistent with alkyl carbons and/or a methyl substituent.4) Putting fragments together  \u2022 The pair of triplets at \u03b4 3.47 / 3.99 (each 2H) matches having a 1,3-dioxolane ring\u2019s CH\u2082 groups or a \u2013CH\u2082\u2013CH\u2082\u2013 bridging O and another electronegative site. However, combined with the formula (two oxygens total) and the need for a single ring, the data fit a ketal (acetal) ring: a 1,3-dioxolane.  \u2022 The 3H singlet at \u03b4 1.94 can be a methyl substituent attached to the acetal (quaternary) carbon.  \u2022 The other four protons at ~1.7 are the \u2013CH\u2082\u2013CH\u2082\u2013 portion bearing Cl at the terminal carbon.  \u2022 Consistent scenario: Start with 4-chloro-2-butanone (CH\u2083\u2013CO\u2013CH\u2082\u2013CH\u2082Cl). React it with ethylene glycol: losing H\u2082O gives an ethylene ketal \u2192 a 1,3-dioxolane ring at the former carbonyl carbon, which thereby bears two substituents: \u2013CH\u2083 and \u2013CH\u2082\u2013CH\u2082Cl.  5) Conclusion  \u2022 The most plausible structure (also fits all coupling patterns and chemical shifts) is 2-(2-chloroethyl)-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###2-(2-chloroethyl)-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane### End answer ###",

But that would be C\u2084H\u2087O\u2082Cl, which is too few carbons (we need C\u2086).  6) Extending the acyl chain from \u201cacetate\u201d \u2192 \u201cpropanoate\u201d (C\u2083) \u2192 \u201cbutanoate\u201d (C\u2084) to match C\u2086 total carbons:     \u2022 2-chloroethyl butanoate is C\u2086H\u2081\u2081O\u2082Cl and would still place the ester methyl environment near 2\u202fppm as a singlet if it were an acetate. But in a butanoate, the terminal CH\u2083 is normally a triplet near ~0.9\u202fppm, and the \u03b1-CH\u2082 to the carbonyl is ~2.3\u202fppm as a quartet or triplet, etc. That conflicts with seeing a 3H singlet at 1.94\u202fppm.   7) Therefore, the simplest consistent assignment\u2014especially given that many routine \u00b9\u00b3C\u202fNMR tables omit the carbonyl resonance (which could be offscale in certain data sets)\u2014is 2-chloroethyl acetate.

That accounts for two carbons, four protons, one O, one Cl.5) That leaves four carbons and one more oxygen still to place.  The remaining \u00b9H signals are (a) 3H singlet at 1.94, (b) 2H dddd at 1.75, (c) 2H m at 1.69.  Altogether these 3 + 2 + 2 = 7\u202fH are on alkyl-like carbons (shifts ~1.6\u20132.0\u202fppm).6) Because there is only one ring or double bond of unsaturation, the most plausible way to incorporate \u201can extra oxygen\u201d (besides the \u2013CH\u2082\u2013CH\u2082\u2013Cl part) and four more carbons is a five-membered ring containing one oxygen (i.e. a tetrahydrofuran-type ring) OR a six-membered ring containing two oxygens (a 1,3-dioxane).  7) A simple 1,3-dioxane ring is C\u2084H\u2088O\u2082.  Substituting one \u2013CH\u2082Cl group would make C\u2085H\u2081\u2080O\u2082Cl.  We still need one more carbon and one more H to get to C\u2086H\u2081\u2081O\u2082Cl.  That extra carbon/hydrogen can be a \u2013CH\u2083 substituent.  8) Hence a likely structure is a 1,3-dioxane ring bearing (a) a \u2013CH\u2082Cl substituent and (b) a \u2013CH\u2083 substituent.  That accounts for C\u2086H\u2081\u2081O\u2082Cl and exactly one ring (the dioxane) as the sole site of unsaturation.9) Which substitution pattern?  A common motif is 5-(chloromethyl)-2-methyl-1,3-dioxane (or equivalently 2-methyl-5-chloromethyl-1,3-dioxane), etc.  That ring substitution pattern explains:     \u2022 The \u2013CH\u2082Cl gives the two triplet-like protons around 3.4\u20133.5\u202fppm (if it is next to oxygen in the ring, the chemical shift fits ~3.4\u20133.5).     \u2022 The ring CH\u2082 next to oxygen can come up around 3.9\u20134.0\u202fppm as the other triplet.     \u2022 The ring\u2019s remaining CH\u2082 groups can show up around 1.6\u20131.8\u202fppm, and the methyl on a ring carbon that is not bearing protons (a quaternary-like center in an acetal ring) can appear as a singlet near ~2\u202fppm.10) Indeed, the known name for this compound is \u201c2-methyl-5-(chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxane.\u201d  That matches formula, integrates to the right number of H, gives four distinct \u00b9\u00b3C signals (the ring is not fully symmetric but only four carbons are unique because substituents create equivalences), and is consistent with the observed \u00b9H pattern.Conclusion: The molecule is 2-methyl-5-(chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxane.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###2-methyl-5-(chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxane### End answer ###",

        "prediction": "### Scratchpad ###1) The molecular formula is C\u2086H\u2081\u2081O\u2082Cl and it has one degree of unsaturation (since halogens count like H in the DBE formula).  A carbonyl is unlikely (no \u00b9\u00b3C above \u224880\u202fppm) and there are two oxygens, so a reasonable guess is that these two oxygens are in a ring (most likely a six\u2010membered diether, i.e. a 1,4\u2010dioxane ring) because that uses up the one degree of unsaturation.2) The \u00b9H NMR shows two distinct \u2013CH\u2082\u2013 groups each appearing as a triplet in the 3.4\u20134.0\u202fppm region (shifts 3.47\u202fppm and 3.99\u202fppm).  This is very suggestive of a 1,4\u2010dioxane ring (whose ring \u2013CH\u2082\u2013 usually comes around 3.6\u20133.7\u202fppm) that is now asymmetrically substituted so that the two sets of ring \u2013CH\u2082\u2013 become non\u2010equivalent (hence two separate triplets).  3) Besides those four protons (two sets of 2H triplets), the spectrum has two more sets of aliphatic 2H signals near 1.7\u202fppm (one is a dddd at 1.75 and the other a multiplet at 1.69) plus a singlet of three protons at 1.94\u202fppm.  Altogether that is 2\u202fH + 2\u202fH + 2\u202fH + 2\u202fH + 3\u202fH = 11\u202fH, matching C\u2086H\u2081\u2081O\u2082Cl.4) The \u00b9\u00b3C NMR gives only four distinct resonances (at about 63.4, 44.3, 25.9, and 20.8\u202fppm), yet we need six carbons total.  Hence there must be some symmetry (or equivalences) in the ring plus substituent.  A classic way to get four \u00b9\u00b3C signals out of six carbons is a 1,4\u2010dioxane ring (which itself, when substituted in a certain symmetric fashion, can collapse its ring carbons into just two distinct sets) plus a substituent that itself has two nonequivalent carbons.  5) Putting it all together fits best if we have a 1,4\u2010dioxane ring bearing a single substituent at (say) the \u201c2\u2010position,\u201d and that substituent itself comprises C\u2082H\u2083Cl in total.  That fragment C\u2082H\u2083Cl corresponds to an ethyl group (C\u2082H\u2085) minus two hydrogens + one chlorine (i.e. we replaced two H on that ring carbon with Cl and an ethyl group), giving the ring carbon four different groups: ring\u2010O, ring\u2010C, Cl, and \u2013CH\u2082CH\u2083.  6) This leads to the structure 2\u2010chloro\u20102\u2010ethyl\u20101,4\u2010dioxane.  The quaternary nature of the substituted ring carbon (it bears an ethyl and a chloro, plus two ring bonds) explains why the ethyl\u2019s protons can end up in patterns consistent with the observed data, and why the \u201cmethyl end\u201d can appear near ~1.9\u202fppm as effectively a singlet integral of 3H in the final spectrum (there is little or no vicinal coupling into that methyl in the particular conformational environment).  7) Hence the name: 2\u2010chloro\u20102\u2010ethyl\u20101,4\u2010dioxane.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###2-chloro-2-ethyl-1,4-dioxane### End answer ###",

The \u00b9\u00b3C NMR peaks (all below ~65\u202fppm) rule out C=O or C=C, so the molecule almost certainly contains one ring.2) In the \u00b9H NMR:   \u2022 Two sets of 2H triplets at 3.47\u202fppm and 3.99\u202fppm (each J\u22486\u202fHz) usually indicate \u2013CH\u2082\u2013CH\u2082\u2013 where each CH\u2082 is next to something electronegative (O or Cl).     \u2022 A singlet for 3H at 1.94\u202fppm suggests a methyl group with no directly coupled protons (often a methyl on a quaternary center).     \u2022 Two remaining 2H groups appear at ~1.7\u202fppm as a dddd (J\u22483\u201311\u202fHz) and a multiplet\u2014consistent with ring methylenes.3) In the \u00b9\u00b3C NMR, there are only four distinct carbons despite having six carbons total.  This indicates symmetry or equivalent sets of carbons.  The most downfield carbon (63.44\u202fppm) is characteristic of a carbon bonded to two oxygens (or similarly strong electronegative environment).  Another at 44.34\u202fppm is typical for a CH\u2082 next to Cl.  The remaining two peaks (25.92\u202fppm and 20.75\u202fppm) are in the normal alkyl region.4) A plausible way to satisfy:   \u2022 One ring containing two oxygens (\u2248\u202fa 1,3-dioxane ring).     \u2022 Substitution pattern that breaks symmetry enough to give four distinct \u00b9\u00b3C signals.     \u2022 Matches the need for a ring (one DU), two O\u2019s, one Cl, and six total carbons.  5) The substitution that fits all data well is \u201c4-chloro-2-ethyl-1,3-dioxane\u201d:   \u2022 1,3-dioxane ring accounts for 4 carbons + 2 oxygens in a six-membered ring.     \u2022 Substituting \u201cchloro\u201d at C-4 and \u201cethyl\u201d at C-2 provides two more carbons and the chlorine, giving C\u2086H\u2081\u2081O\u2082Cl.     \u2022 The 2-ethyl group\u2019s protons and the ring CH\u2082\u2019s explain the 1H patterns (two triplets near 3.5\u20134.0\u202fppm from \u2013CH\u2082\u2013 next to O/Cl, ring methylene signals near 1.7\u202fppm, and the methyl singlet near 1.94\u202fppm from the ethyl group\u2019s splitting pattern being collapsed via the ring environment).### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###4-chloro-2-ethyl-1,3-dioxane### End answer ###",

Splitting 6 carbons and 16 hydrogens into \u201ctwo OCH\u2083 + two OCH\u2082CH\u2083\u201d works perfectly:     \u2022 Two OCH\u2083 groups (2\u202f\u00d7\u202fCH\u2083 = 6H)     \u2022 Two OCH\u2082CH\u2083 groups (each has 2+3=5H, total 10H), together 6+10=16H.     \u2022 Sum of these substituents\u2019 carbons is 2(1) + 2(2)\u202f=\u202f6, plus the central carbon \u2192 C\u2087H\u2081\u2086O\u2084.  5) In that structure (dimethyl diethyl orthocarbonate), the CH\u2083\u2019s can appear as a big singlet (strong deshielding/conformational averaging can collapse the ethyl CH\u2083\u2019s into the same region as the methoxy CH\u2083\u2019s), giving the 12H singlet at ~3.3\u202fppm; the two distinct \u2013CH\u2082\u2013 sets of the ethyl parts appear as triplets (each 2H) at ~1.9 and ~4.45\u202fppm.  Conclusion: The molecule is dimethyl diethyl orthocarbonate.  ### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###dimethyl diethyl orthocarbonate### End answer ###",

Their ~1.7\u20131.8 chemical shifts suggest allylic\u2010type methyl groups.  5) The \u00b9\u00b3C NMR shows only four distinct carbons, so there is considerable symmetry.

That totals 14 hydrogens (2 + 6 + 6 = 14). Singlets suggest either no (or negligible) coupling or high symmetry.  3) The signal at ~6\u202fppm with integral 2H indicates a pair of alkene (vinylic) protons. Having them as one singlet requires that they do not couple\u2014or are magnetically equivalent and any coupling is not observed.  4) The two large singlets of 6H each near 1.7\u20131.8\u202fppm are suggestive of methyl groups in an allylic\u2010type environment (methyls near a C=C). Because each is 6H, that implies there are two sets of two methyl groups (i.e., four methyl substituents in total) or two methyl substituents that each happen to be chemically equivalent in pairs.  5) The \u00b9\u00b3C NMR has only four distinct carbon signals, implying considerable symmetry. Two must be sp\u00b2 (the alkene carbons), and two must be sp\u00b3. That compresses eight carbons into only four \u201cenvironments,\u201d so each environment is repeated in some symmetrical way.  6) Altogether, a consistent structure is one ring plus one double bond (to account for two \u201cdegrees\u201d) with a high degree of symmetry so that there are only four distinct carbons overall: two different alkene carbons and two different sp\u00b3 carbons\u2014yet the total is C\u2088. A known solution matching all these points is 1,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. In this molecule, the ring and substitution pattern can render the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one singlet for 2H), and place the methyl groups in two equivalent sets of three protons each\u2014accounting for the two 6H singlets.  ### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###1,4-Dimethylcyclohex-1-ene### End answer ###",

Total H count is 14 (2 + 6 + 6).2) 13C NMR has only four distinct signals but the formula is C\u2088H\u2081\u2084, so the molecule must be highly symmetrical. Two sp\u00b2 signals (\u2248132 and 121 ppm) fit a vinylidene (exocyclic) arrangement: a quaternary alkene carbon and a methylene alkene carbon. Two sp\u00b3 signals (\u224826 and 18 ppm) suggest two different types of quaternary ring carbons each bearing gem-dimethyl groups.3) Degrees of unsaturation (DU) = 2 (C\u2088H\u2081\u2084 vs. C\u2088H\u2081\u2088). This can be one ring + one double bond. An exocyclic methylene on a small ring with two pairs of gem-dimethyls on the ring carbons explains the high symmetry and all-singlet \u00b9H pattern in the alkyl region.4) A viable structure matching all data is 1-methylene-2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropane:   \u2022 Cyclopropane ring (1 ring = 1 DU)   \u2022 Exocyclic double bond at C1 (adds 1 DU)   \u2022 Two gem-dimethyl substituents on the other ring carbons (C2 and C3) yielding the two singlets of six protons each in \u00b9H NMR.   \u2022 The exocyclic =CH\u2082 accounts for the 5.98 ppm singlet.5) This structure is consistent with the formula, symmetry, and the \u00b9H/\u00b9\u00b3C NMR data.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###1-methylene-2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropane### End answer ###",
