            Here is 1H and 13C NMR spectrum data for a certain molecule {":" if formula is None else f"with chemical formula {formula}:"}
            {nmr_data}
            What's the molecule's name?
            Think step-by-step, making extensive use of a scratchpad to record your thoughts.
            Consider finding ways to group related peaks together, and keep track of the stoichiometry 
            and the amount of unassigned H atoms as you make provisional assignments.
            {"" if formula is None else "Be mindful of stoichiometry and ensure consistency with the given formula." }
            Format the final answer like this - 
            ### Scratchpad ### <scratchpad> ### Scratchpad ###
            ### Start answer ### <prediction> ### End answer ###
            The prediction should only contain the name of the molecule and no other text
