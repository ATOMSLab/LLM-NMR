### Scratchpad ###The singlet at 2.07 ppm for 3H is indicative of a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl (likely an ester). The quartet at 4.14 ppm (2H) and triplet at 1.28 ppm (3H) are consistent with an ethyl group attached to oxygen. The carbonyl resonance at 171.2 ppm in the 13C NMR supports an ester functionality. The 13C shifts (171.2, 60.4, 21.1, 14.2) match an ethyl ester of acetic acid, i.e., ethyl acetate.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###Ethyl acetate### End answer ###

### Scratchpad ###Given the chemical formula C4H8O2, we need to identify a molecule that fits both the 1H and 13C NMR data.1H NMR Analysis:- Peak A: Singlet at 2.07 ppm, integrating to 3 hydrogens. This suggests a methyl group (CH3) adjacent to a carbonyl group.- Peak B: Quartet at 4.14 ppm, integrating to 2 hydrogens. This suggests a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, likely an oxygen (O-CH2-).- Peak C: Triplet at 1.28 ppm, integrating to 3 hydrogens. This suggests a methyl group (CH3) adjacent to a CH2 group.13C NMR Analysis:- Peak A: Singlet at 171.2 ppm, typical for a carbonyl carbon in an ester.- Peak B: Singlet at 60.42 ppm, typical for a carbon attached to an oxygen (O-CH2-).- Peak C: Singlet at 21.08 ppm, typical for a CH2 group.- Peak D: Singlet at 14.22 ppm, typical for a CH3 group.Combining the 1H and 13C NMR data, the structure that fits is an ester. The quartet and triplet in the 1H NMR suggest an ethyl group (CH3CH2-), and the singlet at 2.07 ppm suggests a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (acetyl group).The molecule is likely ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3), which matches the formula C4H8O2 and the NMR data.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ### Ethyl acetate ### End answer ###

### Scratchpad ###1. **Identify all groups of peaks and corresponding hydrogens:***   **1H NMR:**    *   A: 2.07 ppm (s, 3H)    *   B: 4.14 ppm (q, 2H, J=7.14 Hz)    *   C: 1.28 ppm (t, 3H, J=7.16 Hz)*   **13C NMR:**    *   A: 171.2 ppm (s)    *   B: 60.42 ppm (s)    *   C: 21.08 ppm (s)    *   D: 14.22 ppm (s)2. **Stoichiometry check:***   The data indicates 3 + 2 + 3 = 8 H in 1H NMR, which matches the formula C4H8O2.*   The 13C NMR shows 4 distinct carbon environments, as required by the formula.3. **Fragment hypotheses:***   **1H NMR:**    *   A: 2.07 ppm (s, 3H): CH3-C=O. Singlet suggests adjacent to a carbonyl, shifted slightly downfield due to its presence.    *   B: 4.14 ppm (q, 2H, J=7.14 Hz): -CH2-O-. Quartet suggests it's next to a methyl group and shifted downfield due to an oxygen. This suggests an ethyl group.    *   C: 1.28 ppm (t, 3H, J=7.16 Hz): -CH3. Triplet suggests it's next to a methylene group. The coupling constant matches with the quartet at 4.14 ppm.*   **13C NMR:**    *   A: 171.2 ppm (s): Most likely a carbonyl carbon (C=O) from an ester or carboxylic acid.    *   B: 60.42 ppm (s): Carbon single bond to Oxygen. Matches the methylene group at 4.14 ppm in the 1H NMR.    *   C: 21.08 ppm (s): Methyl carbon. Attached to carbonyl    *   D: 14.22 ppm (s): Terminal Methyl carbon.4. **Plausibility and molecule building:***   Combining the fragments CH3-C=O, -CH2-O- and -CH3, and the carbonyl carbon, suggests an ester. The fragments strongly indicate the presence of an ethyl group (CH3CH2-) and an acetyl group (CH3C(O)-).*   Therefore, the molecule is most likely ethyl acetate.### End Scratchpad ###
