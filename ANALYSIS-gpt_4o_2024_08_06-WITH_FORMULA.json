Analysis and Hypothesis:   - The presence of a peak at 220.98 ppm in the 13C NMR is indicative of a carbonyl carbon, which is typical for ketones.   - The 1H NMR shows two sets of equivalent hydrogens, each contributing 4 hydrogens, both appearing as singlets.

Possible Structure:   - Considering the symmetry suggested by the 1H NMR and the carbonyl peak in the 13C, a likely candidate could be a molecule with a carbonyl group flanked by two identical groups containing two CH2 units.   - The structure fitting C5H8O with this NMR data is 2-pentanone:     - CH3COCH2CH2CH3 (though it doesn't fully match the symmetry, further analysis may be required)6. Verification:   - The peaks at 1.96 and 2.16 ppm in the 1H NMR could be methylene groups (CH2) next to a carbonyl group because the chemical shifts are downfield due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyl.   - The 13C NMR supports this structure:     - 220.98 ppm for carbonyl carbon     - 38.52 and 23.37 ppm for the methylene and methyl carbons.7.

The chemical composition includes one oxygen more, so it must be a derivative including another oxygen, typically found in esters like ethyl hydrogen carbonate or ethyl oxalate.Given that we have C5H10O3, an educated guess can be ethyl hydrogen carbonate or ethyl oxalate.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ### Ethyl oxalate ### End answer ###",

Analyzing 13C NMR:   - 13C peak at 165.71 ppm:        - Typically corresponds to a carbonyl carbon such as in amides, esters, etc.        - Since we have a nitrogen in the formula, this could likely be an amide carbon (i.e., O=C-N).   - 13C peak at 38.68 ppm:        - This chemical shift could correspond to a carbon attached to nitrogen or part of a saturated (aliphatic) system.3. Estimating molecular structure:   - With C5H12N2O, we should consider an amide group due to the 13C peak at 165.71 ppm.4. Analyzing 1H NMR:   - 1H peak at 2.76 ppm, singlet, integrated for 12 protons.     - All protons give a single peak which suggests they are in a similar environment.     - Number of protons seems unusually high at first glance, but indicates symmetry or equivalent hydrogen presence somewhere in the structure.     - Since it's a singlet, there's no adjacent hydrogen causing splitting (no coupling), suggesting that the protons are on a nitrogen or tertiary/carbonyl-adjacent carbon.5. Consideration:   - The given integral for hydrogens in the 1H NMR (12) seems unusually high, likely pointing to symmetry.   - The actual hydrogen counts must be C5H12N2O, having only 12 hydrogens, not all with equivalent surroundings; the integral is a relative number.   - Possible structure could be N,N-dimethylacetamide or a similar compound aligning with C5H12N2O.   - (CH3)2N-(CO)-CH3 has amide environment for the carbonyl and dimethyl groups around nitrogen which may explain 1H singlet.   - Verify molecular structure fits the given ranges and integral values.   - Proton environment suitably fits singlet peak when all three methyl groups contribute equally.   - Conformity with chemical shift ranges for carbons and protons.Overall thought track moved towards a simple amide with symmetry or a straightforward nature involving N,N-dimethyl substituents and a simple carbonyl (suggested by a common structure in chemical literature):### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###N,N-dimethylacetamide### End answer ###",

The singlet class (s) indicates no coupling, suggesting these hydrogens are in a symmetrical environment.13C NMR:- Peak A at 165.71 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an amide (C=O connected to nitrogen), due to the presence of nitrogen in the formula.- Peak B at 38.68 ppm suggests a carbon near a nitrogen atom or in a saturated aliphatic environment. The presence of a single peak in both 1H and 13C NMR, each integrating to the total number of hydrogens and carbons, respectively, suggests a high degree of symmetry in the molecule. A likely candidate is a cyclic or linear symmetrical compound.Considering C5H12N2O and the data:- NMR data suggests a symmetrical structure.- The carbonyl carbon (165.71 ppm) and nitrogen presence points to an amide.- The simplest symmetrical structure that fits the formula and data is a linear amide: N,N-dimethylpropionamide.Structure analysis:- The N,N-dimethyl groups contribute to symmetry (hydrogens are equivalent), consistent with the singlet in 1H NMR.- The amide carbonyl group explains the 13C NMR peak at 165.71 ppm.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ### N,N-Dimethylpropionamide ### End answer ###",

This shift corresponds to a methylene carbon adjacent to an oxygen or another electron-withdrawing group (helping to confirm peak C in the 1H NMR).4. Peak G: \u03b4 29.34. This shift suggests a methyl or methylene carbon, likely the methyl group characterized by the singlet at 2.18 ppm in the 1H spectrum.**Combining 1H and 13C NMR:**Putting this together, we have:- A phenyl group contributing the aromatic proton multiplet and aromatic carbons in the 13C NMR.- A methylene group near an oxygen, likely part of \u2013O\u2013CH2\u2013.- A methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl, evidenced by the chemical shifts.Additionally, the single carbonyl carbon suggests a ketone and the overall formula C9H10O matches that of a substituted acetophenone. Given these clues, a logical candidate is:- 4-Methylacetophenone (also known as p-tolyl methyl ketone), where:  - The phenyl group explains the aromatic protons and carbons.  - The methyl group on the aromatic ring provides the singlet at 2.18 ppm.  - The ketone explains the carbonyl shift at 206.46 ppm.  - The methylene attached to oxygen extends as acetophenone moiety.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###4-Methylacetophenone### End answer ###",

This suggests a possible aromatic compound given the unsaturation.    - Checking all hydrogens in the 1H NMR: A (5) + B (3) + C (2) = 10 hydrogens, which matches the formula.2. **1H NMR Analysis**    - **Peak A**: Multiplet at 7.31 ppm, integrated for 5 hydrogens. This suggests an aromatic benzene ring with overlapping signals, typical for an unsubstituted phenyl group.    - **Peak B**: Singlet at 2.18 ppm, integrated for 3 hydrogens. This suggests a methyl group (CH3) likely attached to a carbonyl or potentially a phenyl ring.    - **Peak C**: Singlet at 3.72 ppm, integrated for 2 hydrogens. This suggests a methylene group (CH2) or an -OCH2- fragment given the shift is near 4 ppm.3. **13C NMR Analysis**    - **Peak A**: 206.46 ppm. This suggests a carbonyl carbon, likely a ketone due to the high shift value.    - **Peaks B-E**: Chemical shifts (127-134 ppm) typical for aromatic carbons, confirming the presence of a benzene ring.    - **Peak F**: 51.08 ppm suggests a methylene group (CH2) attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen (likely an -OCH2-).    - **Peak G**: 29.34 ppm suggests a methyl group (CH3) attached possibly to a carbonyl group (typical of acetyl).4. **Hypotheses for Fragments**    - Benzene ring with possible substituents, as indicated by Peak A (5 hydrogens).    - Acetyl group: CH3CO- as suggested by Peak B (singlet for 3 hydrogens in 1H NMR and corresponding carbon in 13C NMR).    - Methoxymethyl or methylene attached possibly via ether linkage: -OCH2- as suggested by Peak C in 1H NMR and the matching carbon in 13C NMR.5. **Synthesizing the Molecule**    - Combine all fragments: a benzene ring, a carbonyl group (C=O from the acetyl group), a methoxy unit.    - Assumption: The molecule could be an aromatic ketone like an acetophenone derivative with a potential methoxy group.    - Given all the data, acetophenone matches all the shifts considering a ketone with a phenyl group.6. **Prediction**    - Putting it all together, the arrangement likely leads to a molecule with a phenyl group, an acetyl methyl group, and possibly a methylene linked to oxygen or another plausible linkage method.    - **Conclusion**: The molecule likely to match is *4-Methoxyphenylacetone*.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###4-Methoxyphenylacetone### End answer ###",

Peaks at 132.13, 130.08, and 114.44 ppm correspond to aromatic carbons.4. A peak at 55.72 ppm corresponds to an OCH3 group.The combination of both aldehyde and methoxy groups fits well with a molecule that has those characteristics. Combining these observations with the molecular formula C8H8O2, it aligns with methyl 4-formylbenzoate:- The structure comprises an aromatic ring with:  - A methoxy group (OCH3) corresponding to a peak around 3.89 ppm in the 1H NMR which matches the 13C NMR peak at 55.72 ppm.  - An aldehyde group (CHO) contributing the peak at 9.88 ppm in proton and 190.97 ppm in carbon spectra.  - The remaining aromatic protons are covered by signals at 7.0 ppm and 7.83 ppm.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ### Methyl 4-formylbenzoate ### End answer ###",

This suggests there may be two double bonds, a triple bond, or a ring.#### Solvent:- Solvent peaks are not indicated here, so assume they do not interfere.#### 1H NMR Analysis:- **Peak A**:   - Chemical shift at 1.93 ppm  - Integral of 3 suggests 3 hydrogens; it's a singlet  - The downfield shift suggests the hydrogens are not purely aliphatic and could be near an electron-withdrawing group, possibly adjacent to a nitrogen or a sp-linked carbon.#### 13C NMR Analysis:- **Carbon Peak A (116.5 ppm)**:   - Typical of an sp2 or sp carbon; consistent with a carbon triple-bonded to another carbon or nitrogen   - Coupled to one hydrogen; possibly an sp-hybridized CH- **Carbon Peak B (1.63 ppm)**:  - Could be an aliphatic carbon  - Integral and hydrogens suggest a methyl group#### Summary:- **Structure implications**:  - C2H3N implies a small molecule with one degree of unsaturation account probably by a triple bond since we have a sp-hybridized carbon with hydrogen.  - CH3 group from 1H NMR and potentially supported by carbon peak B.### Conclusion:- Possible structure: Propyne variant like methyl isocyanide where the molecule has a methyl group (CH3-) attached to an sp carbon (indicating a linkage like -C\u2261N).- Consistent with 1H NMR having a singlet peak at 1.93 for the methyl group and 13C NMR showing deshielded sp carbon and methyl-like carbon shifts.- Therefore, the most likely candidate is methyl isocyanide (CH3N\u2261C).### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ###Methyl isocyanide### End answer ###",

The degree of unsaturation can be calculated by using the formula:\\[ \\text{Degree of unsaturation} = \\frac{2C + 2 + N - H - X}{2} = \\frac{2 \\times 9 + 2 + 1 - 11}{2} = 6 \\]A degree of unsaturation of 6 suggests multiple rings or multiple \u03c0 bonds or a combination.**1H NMR analysis:**1. Peak A (s, 3.09 ppm, 6H): Singlet, 6 hydrogens. This is likely two equivalent methyl groups, possibly N,N-dimethyl group or a part of a methoxy substituent.2. Peak B (s, 9.76 ppm, 1H): Singlet, 1 hydrogen. This shift is typical for an aldehyde hydrogen.3. Peak C (dt, 7.75 ppm, 2H): Doublet of triplets, 2 hydrogens. These shifts are common for aromatic hydrogens adjacent to heteroatoms or another ring substituent.4. Peak D (td, 6.8 ppm, 2H): Triplet of doublets, 2 hydrogens. Also indicative of aromatic protons, suggesting substitution pattern on a benzene ring.**13C NMR analysis:**1. Peak A (s, 190.43 ppm): C=O of an aldehyde group.2. Peak B (s, 153.91 ppm): C-N or C-O bonded to a highly electronegative substituent or part of an aromatic, such as in a pyridine or pyrrole.3. Peak C (s, 132.07 ppm), D (s, 126.1 ppm), E (s, 111.95 ppm): Aromatic carbons, typical for a phenyl ring pattern.4. Peak F (s, 40.68 ppm): Likely a methyl carbon next to a nitrogen.Analyzing these observations, the 1H and 13C NMR data suggest the presence of an aromatic ring and a formyl (CHO) group, considering there is a distinct aldehyde peak. Given the presence of a likely N,N-dimethyl group based on the peak at 3.09 ppm, a plausible molecule could be N,N-dimethylbenzylamine or N,N-dimethylaniline derivative.Taking into account the presence of nitrogen, observing the chemical shifts, and considering the unsaturation degree, the structure that fits all this data is N,N-dimethylaniline, which would account for the aromatic protons, N-methyl groups, and a lack of resonance further upfield that would've suggested simple methyl groups elsewhere.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ### N,N-dimethylaniline ### End answer ###",

Given the chemical shifts and the integration pattern, it seems reasonable to consider the presence of a thioether (C-S-C) linkage which could correspond to the downfield shift in the 1H NMR and the presence of sulfur in the formula. The 57.32 ppm shift in 13C NMR is consistent with a carbon adjacent to sulfur.5. Possible structure: Consider a benzyl group (C6H5-CH2-) attached to a sulfur atom. The peak at 3.9 ppm (1H NMR quartet) could be a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to a sulfur, which is part of a thioether linkage.6. Possible molecules: One common molecule that fits this description is a thioether derivative like benzyl phenyl sulfide.7.

The given molecule has the formula C6H13ClO2 which suggests it could be a haloalkane or some other functional group with a chlorine and possibly an ether or alcohol group, based on the presence of oxygen atoms.2. **1H NMR Analysis**:   - Peak A: Triplet at 1.23 ppm with 6 hydrogens. This indicates two equivalent CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2 group (due to the triplet).   - Peak B: Doublet at 3.5 ppm with 2 hydrogens, likely suggests a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen (common for alcohols or ether linkage) and another carbon.   - Peak C and D: Both are doublet of quartets around 3.58 and 3.7 ppm. These signals are likely from two different CH2 groups, one attached to an oxygen atom and the other attached to a carbon that is bonded to chlorine, as deduced from the split pattern and the presence of J-values.   - Peak E: Triplet at 4.62 ppm with 1 hydrogen, likely indicating a CH that's adjacent on one side to a chlorine atom.3. **13C NMR Analysis**:   - Peak A at 101.79 ppm seems unusually high for most aliphatic carbons and suggests significant deshielding possibly due to an electronegative element like oxygen or chlorine nearby.   - Peaks B, C, and D are at 62.66, 44.04, and 15.33 ppm, respectively, which can correspond to different CH2 and CH carbons.4. Given the pattern of splitting and chemical shifts, consider a molecule such as 1-chloro-2-methoxypropane or another similar structure, with a chlorine attached to a secondary carbon as Peak E indicates a single hydrogen.5. Two methoxy (-OCH2CH3) groups can account for the arrangement of atoms to result in consistent NMR shifts. There might be interference from the methylene chloride as an impurity, but since it is present in several NMR chemicals, it isn't a predominant problem.6. The chemical shifts for aliphatic and chloro groups align with a possible structure such as 2-chloro-1-methoxypropane or something similar.Thus, considering the aforementioned analysis and ensuring that everything fits the C6H13ClO2 formula and the NMR data:### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ### 2-chloro-1-methoxypropane ### End answer ###",

Triplet with J = 7.69 Hz. Likely suggests a methyl group adjacent to a methylene.   - **Peak B (m)**: Shift of 2.52, 1 hydrogen, multiplet.

Their proximity in shifts and complexity indicate a conjugated system likely present in a double bond-rich region like an enone or thiocarbonyl system.4. **Analyzing 13C NMR Data**:   - **Peak A (s)** at 136.88 ppm could be a vinyl carbon, possibly the more deshielded due to electron-withdrawing oxygen.   - **Peak B (s)** at 129.93 ppm suggests another alkene carbon, slightly less deshielded.5. **Forming a Structure Hypothesis**:    - The clear presence of vinyl and potentially enone signals narrows possibilities to conjugated systems with these structural moieties.   - Given the chemical shifts, possible presence of a thiocarbonyl or ester may account for the sulfur and oxygen atoms.   - Matching usual chemical shifts and couplings for systems such as acrolein sulfides or thiol-enabled vinyl systems limit possibilities.6. **Considering Stoichiometry**:    - Formula C4H6O2S fits compounds like thiopropene carboxylic acid-like structures. Confirming through building such a conjugated system matches properties seen in data.   - Through elimination, thiophene or thiol-actuated multiple unsaturations suggesting **thioglycolic acid** derivatives.By assessing the general coupling patterns and their match to the carbon shifts, the doublets align with sulfur which is seen in thioketones.

This is characteristic of methyl groups adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups like carbonyls or aromatic rings.- Both A and B integrate to 3 hydrogens each, consistent with methyl groups.- Peaks C and D are multiplets around 7 ppm, typical for aromatic hydrogens. They integrate to 2 hydrogens each, suggesting a disubstituted aromatic ring.Next, the 13C NMR data:- Peak A at 148.51 ppm is typical for a carbon-oxygen bond in an aromatic ring or a highly deshielded carbon.- Peak B at 135.47 ppm and Peaks C and D at around 130 ppm are consistent with aromatic carbons.- Peaks E (21.11 ppm) and F (20.87 ppm) are typical of aliphatic methyl groups, matching our prediction from the 1H NMR.Given the above analysis, the molecule likely contains a disubstituted benzene ring with two methyl groups. The chemical shifts suggest a -COCH3 (acetyl group) as a substituent, which could account for the electron-withdrawing effect and the deshielding observed. Therefore, the structure is likely a substituted aromatic ketone.C9H10O2 suggests this could be an acetophenone derivative. Let's test this hypothesis against known compounds with this formula. One common acetophenone derivative with these characteristics is \"1,4-dimethoxybenzene,\" but it doesn't fit the description due to oxygen count and hydrogen distribution.Instead, consider a phthalic ester like \"methyl benzoate\" or similar structures, but with symmetry: \"1-methoxy-4-methylbenzene\" (p-cresyl methyl ether) fits the symmetry and NMR characteristics:- Two methyl groups (one aromatic ring substituent, one ether substituted)- A methyl ether group could create the chemical shifts observed.Given the above, the molecule is likely \"1-methoxy-4-methylbenzene\".### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ### 4-methylphenol ### End answer ###",

In this case, aromatic rings are highly probable.**1H NMR Analysis:**- Peak A: 9.73 ppm, singlet, integral 1.0. This is characteristic of an aldehyde proton.- Peak B: 4.11 ppm, singlet, integral 2.19. This could indicate a methylene (CH2) group attached to an oxygen, such as in an ether or ester.- Peak C: 4.64 ppm, singlet, integral 2.2. Similar to Peak B, another methylene likely attached to oxygen.- Peak D: 7.37 ppm, multiplet, integral 4.87. This suggests aromatic protons, likely from a benzene ring (5 protons).**13C NMR Analysis:**- Assuming the 13C NMR data was entered incorrectly, as it repeats the 1H NMR data. Typically, 13C NMR would give distinct signals for carbon atoms.**Structural Construction:**- Aromatic protons at ~7.37 ppm confirm a benzene ring.- The aldehyde peak at 9.73 ppm suggests the presence of an aldehyde group.- Given that we have two methylene groups (likely attached to oxygen), this suggests an ester, as these protons would appear around 4 ppm.**Molecule Hypothesis:**- Potential structure: benzaldehyde with an attached methoxy group (methoxycarbonyl).- Fitting the elements together: Benzene ring with an aldehyde (CHO), methoxy (OCH3), and the remaining methylene (CH2) connecting these groups to match the C9H10O2 formula.**Conclusion:**- Based on the evidence and typical chemical shifts, the molecule is most likely methyl phenylacetate.

This suggests a methyl group (CH3) adjacent to a CH2 group (forming a triplet).- Peak B: 4.18 ppm (q, 2H), J = ~7.13 Hz. This suggests a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to a CH3 group (forming a quartet).- Peak C: 6.69 ppm (d, 1H), J = 15.77 Hz- Peak D: 6.64 ppm (d, 1H), J = 15.79 Hz. The high J values for C and D imply they are part of a trans-alkene (trans coupling).13C NMR:- Peak A: 166.12 ppm. Likely a carbonyl carbon of an ester (C=O).- Peak B: 164.97 ppm. Another carbonyl carbon, possibly indicative of another ester.- Peak C and D: 135.24 ppm and 132.59 ppm. These shifts are in the alkene region.- Peak E: 61.28 ppm. This is consistent with a methylene carbon (CH2) bonded to electronegative atoms/functional groups, often seen in esters.- Peak F: 14.17 ppm. This is consistent with a methyl carbon (CH3).Based on this information:- The splitting pattern and chemical shifts, especially the alkenes and carbonyls, suggest a conjugated ester.- A common structure fitting C6H8O4 with these shifts is an unsaturated diester. - Given the J values for C and D, the high coupling constant alignment with trans-alkene peaks coupled with ester functionality around methylene and methyl groups suggest:  - Methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3) doesn't fit since it doesn't have a matching carbon count; however, something similar on an ester linkage does.Combining observations:- Ethyl trans-acrylate seems more plausible: an ethyl group (CH2CH3) providing quartets and triplets and a couple of deshielded protons from alkene with the trans configuration.Final molecule:- Ethyl trans-acrylate seems consistent with the NMR data and formula C6H8O4.### Scratchpad ###### Start answer ### Ethyl trans-acrylate ### End answer ###",

The peaks at 1.8 ppm and 1.74 ppm are in the aliphatic region and are singlet, suggesting they are methyl groups.3. **13C NMR Analysis**:   - Peak A (132.27 ppm): Likely indicates a sp2 hybridized carbon (C=C).   - Peak B (121.42 ppm): Another sp2 hybridized carbon.   - Peak C (26.38 ppm): Sp3 hybridized carbon, likely part of methylene or carbon of a methyl group.   - Peak D (18.13 ppm): Another sp3 hybridized carbon, possibly a methyl group.4. Interpretation:      - The two sp2 C signals correspond to a C=C double bond, aligning with singlet 2H peak in the 1H NMR suggesting a CH2 group.   - The molecule should have some symmetrical elements given the redundancy in 1H signals:     - The two sets of 6H at 1.8 ppm and 1.74 ppm hint all these might belong to equivalent methyl groups.   - Total protons: 2 + 6 + 6 = 14 so it's consistent with the formula C8H14.   - This could be an indication of symmetry where two identical halves contain the methyl and methylene groups across the double bond. 5.
